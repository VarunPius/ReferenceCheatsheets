# Start Virtual Environment
When developing software with Python, a basic approach is to install Python on your machine, install all your required libraries via the terminal, write all your code in a single `.py` file or notebook, and run your Python program in the terminal.

But in complex software development projects, like building a Python library, an API, or software development kit, often you will be working with multiple files, multiple packages, and dependencies. As a result, you will need to isolate your Python development environment for that particular project. This helps when project A uses library P with version x while project B uses same library P with version y. This is result in an error, or alternative is reinstalling the versions.

When you activate a virtual environment for your project, your project becomes its own self contained application, independent of the system installed Python and its modules. Your new virtual environment has its own pip to install libraries, its own libraries folder, where new libraries are added, and its own Python interpreter for the Python version you used to activate the environment.

With this new environment, your application becomes self-contained and you get some benefits such as:
- Dev environment is contained within your project, is isolated, and does not interfere with your system installed Python or other virtual environments
- Create a new virtual environment for multiple Python versions
- Download packages into your project without admin privileges
- Package application and share with other developers to replicate
- Create a list of dependencies and sub-dependencies in a file, for your project, which makes it easy for other developers to replicate and install all the dependencies used within your environment

Using virtual environments is recommended for software development projects that generally grow out of a single Python script, and Python provides multiple ways of creating and using a virtual environment.

Here, I am using `venv` (Virtualenv) but there are alternatives such as `pipenv`, which is a more high level approach.

## Install a Virtual Environment using Venv

Virtualenv is a tool to set up your Python environments. Since Python 3.3, a subset of it has been integrated into the standard library under the venv module. You can install venv to your host Python by running this command in your terminal:
```
pip install virtualenv
```

To use venv in your project, in your terminal, create a new project folder, cd to the project folder in your terminal, and run the following command:
```
python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
```

For example:
```
mkdir projectA
cd projectA
python3.8 -m venv venv
# or
python -m venv venv
```

When you check the new `projectA` folder, you will notice that a new folder called `venv` has been created. `venv` is the name of our virtual environment, but it can be named anything you want.

If we check the contents of `venv` for a bit, on a Mac you will see a `bin` folder. You will also see scripts that are typically used to control your virtual environment, such as activate and pip to install libraries, and the Python interpreter for the Python version you installed, and so on. 
> (This folder will be called `Scripts` on windows).

The `lib` folder will contain a list of libraries that you have installed. If you take a look at it, you will see a list of the libraries that come by default with the virtual environment.

## Activate the Virtual Environment
Now that you have created the virtual environment, you will need to activate it before you can use it in your project. On a Mac, to activate your virtual environment, run the code below:
```
source env/bin/activate
```

This will activate your virtual environment. Immediately, you will notice that your terminal path includes `venv`, signifying an activated virtual environment.

Note that to activate your virtual environment on Windows, you will need to run the following code below (See this link to fully understand the differences between platforms):
```
env/Scripts/activate.bat //In CMD
env/Scripts/Activate.ps1 //In Powershel
```

## Debugging
We have activated our virtual environment, now how do we confirm that our project is in fact isolated from our host Python? We can do a couple of things.

First we check the list of packages installed in our virtual environment by running the code below in the activated virtual environment. You will notice only two packages â€“ `pip` and `setuptools`, which are the base packages that come default with a new virtual environment
```
pip list
```

Next you can run the same code above in a new terminal in which you haven't activated the virtual environment. You will notice a lot more libraries in your host Python that you may have installed in the past. These libraries are not part of your Python virtual environment until you install them.

## Install Libraries in a Virtual Environment
To install new libraries, you can easily just `pip install` the libraries. The virtual environment will make use of its own pip, so you don't need to use pip3.

After installing your required libraries, you can view all installed libraries by using `pip list`, or you can generate a text file listing all your project dependencies by running the code below:
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

You can name this `requirements.txt` file whatever you want.

## Requirements File
To recreate your development environment for your friend will just need to follow the above steps to activate a new virtual environment. Instead of having to install each dependency one by one, they could just run the code below to install all your dependencies within their own copy of the project:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note that it is generally not advisable to share your `venv` folder, and it should be easily replicated in any new environment.

Typically your `venv` directory will be included in a `.gitignore` file (when using version control platforms like GitHub) to ensure that the environment file is not pushed to the project repository.

## Deactivate a Virtual Environment
To deactivate your virtual environment, simply run the following code in the terminal:
```
~ deactivate
```

# Manage Different Python Versions
Pyenv is a tool used for managing multiple Python versions on a single system.
With Pyenv, you can easily install and switch between different versions of Python, as well as manage virtual environments for your projects.
Pyenv allows you to install different versions of Python from various sources, such as the official Python release website, the Anaconda distribution, or even from GitHub.
Once you have multiple Python versions installed, you can use Pyenv to switch between them on the command line.

## Installation:
- For MacOS, use Homebrew:
    ```
    brew install pyenv
    ```
- Define environment variable `PYENV_ROOT` to point to the path where Pyenv will store its data.
    ```
    echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```
    If not in the `.zshrc` file, copy the following:
    ```
    export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
    command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
    eval "$(pyenv init -)"
    ```
    If you wish to get Pyenv in noninteractive login shells as well, also add the commands to ~/.zprofile or ~/.zlogin.

## Commands
- List all Python versions
    ```
    pyenv versions
    ```
- List **current** Python versions
    ```
    pyenv version
    ```
- List all Python installation options:
    ```
    pyenv install -l
    pyenv install --list
    pyenv install --list | grep "jython"
    # for listing versions from 3.6 to 3.8
    pyenv install --list | grep " 3\.[678]"
    ```
- Install Python version:
    ```
    pyenv install -v <version>
    pyenv install -v 3.9.1
    ```
- Change Python version Globally (select globally for your user account):
    ```
    pyenv global <version>
    pyenv global 3.9.1
    ```
- Change Python version for specific project (automatically select whenever you are in the current directory or its subdirectories):
    ```
    pyenv local <version>
    pyenv local 2.7.15
    ```
- Change Python version for specific shell (select just for current shell session):
    ```
    pyenv shell <version>
    pyenv shell 3.8-dev
    ```
- Exploring available Pyenv commands:
    ```
    pyenv commands
    ```
- Uninstall Python version:
    ```
    pyenv uninstall <versions>
    ```
